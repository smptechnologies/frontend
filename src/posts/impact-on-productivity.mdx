## Technology, AI and our lives 


In a world evolving at a very fast pace, technological advancements continue to shape and redefine the ways in which we live, communicate and work.
One of these advancements, Artificial Intelligence (AI), has emerged as a groundbreaking force. While not a lot of years ago the words “Artificial” and “Intelligence” combined could mean little to nothing to many, this technology is now a pressing topic, which has come to stay and expand its presence, with AI market size being expected to reach nearly $2 trillion by 2030, more than 20x its value in 2021<a href="#ref1" className=""><sup>1</sup></a>.

With autonomous-driving cars, personal assistants or smart home devices, it can revolutionize many aspects of our lives, one of which, our work. As AI continues to advance, its integration into the workplace becomes stronger, helping to reshape the way work is done, redefining the traditional notions of productivity and having the potential to change the manner in which workers' time and mental energy are spent. 

## Productivity is expected to increase
 
AI can be of crucial help in a multitude of occupations and, even though ChatGPT is currently a prominent example of it, with its wide applicability being undeniable, there are other various AI tools specific for different tasks and industries. For example, in the healthcare sector, tools such as IBM Watson help by assisting in medical diagnosis, analyzing patient data, and suggesting personalized treatment plans. Or in finance, where algorithms can analyze big amounts of data, making high-speed investment decisions at a superhuman level. This level of assistance and automation can lead to major decreases in time spent in AI-susceptible tasks, opening up a broad set of economic possibilities.
However,  its impact varies greatly depending on the industry. In fact, banking, high tech, and life sciences seem to be the leading the industries in which impact as a percentage of revenue directly attributed to generative AI could be the largest<a href="#ref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.

Current generative AI and other technologies have the potential to automate work activities that consume 60% to 70% of employees’ time today. As opposed to what used to happen with previous technology, generative AI has the ability to understand natural language at a seemingly human level, thus the possibility of replacing humans in their respective activities emerges.
 
64% of businesses expect AI to increase their overall productivity<a href="#ref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. And this seems to actually occur: a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research (USA)<a href="#ref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, shows a 13.8% increase in the number of chats that a worker in the customer service sector is able to successfully resolve per hour, resulting in improved efficiency and productivity levels. In this case, three components of productivity shift: an agent takes less time to handle an individual chat, there is an increase in the number of chats that they are  able to handle per hour and a small increase in the share of chats that are successfully resolved. 

## Its impacts differ widely across types of workers and jobs
                                                                                                      
It should not be overlooked that these impacts differ depending on the level of expertise of the workers. Workers whose skills and experience levels are lower, experience a disproportionate increase in productivity measures. This happens because AI recommendations capture the more “implicit” knowledge inherent in the behavior of more skilled workers, whereas low-skilled workers are more likely to improve by incorporating these behaviors by adhering to AI suggestions. For example, a worker with lower writing skills is now easily able to produce an e-mail or letter similar to one that a high-skilled worker would. In other words, this leveling effect of AI helps narrow the productivity gap between workers with different ability levels.

Generative AI has a greater influence on knowledge work linked to occupations that demand higher wages and educational qualifications compared to other forms of work. These higher paying and more qualified jobs are usually connected to the digital realm, requiring more decision-making and problem-solving skills, hence the greater applicability of this kind of technology.

On the other hand, non-generative AI can have a considerable effect in jobs that require physical effort. Measuring 177 cm and weighing 57 kg, Tesla's humanoid robot Optimus can carry 20 kg at a speed of 8 km/h<a href="#ref5"><sup>5</sup></a>. With such it has the potential to replace humans in numerous activities. Nevertheless, the robot is still far from becoming a reality that can be adopted by the world at large: considerable development is still required before it is production-ready and available for purchase. This and other technologies of similar type are being developed and promise to change the way manual labor is carried out.

## Challenges and the future

Problems with AI are also important to mention. Despite its very positive aspects, it raises multiple complex ethical questions which not only affect the individual but also the society it is surrounded by: problems with hidden biases, which come from a variety of sources such as the the training dataset or the algorithms used; difficulties in attributing responsibility to its actions and outcomes; errors it may produce and problems that come with diagnosing and correcting them<a href="#ref6"><sup>6</sup></a>; the growing invasion of privacy and concerns about data security; among others.

 
It is important to conduct studies on the economic impact of these tools because, while we imagine AI  to have a positive impact on worker’s lives, looking promising in a theoretical setting, it may have a more limited effect in the real world. It is also crucial to approach its implementation thoughtfully and ethically, ensuring that workers' inclusivity and well-being are prioritized.
 
It is indisputable that AI can truly modify the workspace, work in itself and, with that, productivity. This is merely the beginning and many questions remain unanswered. How will workers’ compensation change? Will there be a shift in the number of hours worked? Will this predominantly lead to job displacement, or conversely, will it be outweighed by the creation of new jobs?

These answers are coming soon. We just need to remain attentive and observe how this remarkable technology unfolds and transforms our world.
